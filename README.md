## Description

It started as a challenge: allow the user to blow out a candle by literally blowing on their phone! Well, touchscreens don't register breath as touch, even if it can detect a low force value (I tested). So, I engaged the microphone and analyzed the sound of a human blowing into it. If there's a match, the candle flame extinguishes...then reignites two seconds later.

Additionally, I threw in some orientation sensing so the flame moves with the phone tilt. Fun exploration and demo!

Built with vanilla JavaScript, my favorite flavor!
