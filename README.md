## Description

It started as a challenge: allow the user to blow out a candle by literally blowing on their phone! Well, touchscreens don't register breath as touch, even if it can detect a low force value (I tested). So, I'm a bit stuck on that one for now. Possibilities include audio or visual input...

Instead, I threw in some orientation sensing so the flame moves with the phone tilt. That'll have to do for now.

Built with vanilla JavaScript, my favorite flavor!
